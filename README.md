Most of these scripts are written based on my specific server environment, so they probably won't work as-is in any other environment.
I usually try to write universal scripts but some choices are made either because I don't care or because (for me) it's better that way.

There usually aren't any comments, but the code is self-explanatory. Feel free to grab a clone of this repo and edit it to match your environment.
